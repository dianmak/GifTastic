# GifTastic

A dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the user's choice. 8 buttons are pre-created from a topics array, after which the user is able to submit string input to create new buttons. Clicking each button displays 10 gifs that are pulled from the Giphy API with the button value as query. Clicking the gifs switches them from animated and still states.
